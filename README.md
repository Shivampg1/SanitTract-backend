# SanitTract-backend

üìå Overview
This project implements a real-time hospital bed monitoring system using OpenCV, YOLO object detection, and MediaPipe hand tracking. It detects hand wiping movements to determine cleanliness and uses YOLO object detection to identify unnecessary objects on the bed. Additionally, it sends email reports with bed cleanliness analysis.

üöÄ Features
Real-Time Hand Detection ‚Üí Tracks motion to detect wiping action.

YOLO Object Detection ‚Üí Identifies unnecessary objects on the bed. YOLO V8 is upgraded version

Cleanliness Analysis ‚Üí Measures the cleanliness of the bed based on pixel thresholds.

Automated Email Reports ‚Üí Sends cleanliness reports via email.
